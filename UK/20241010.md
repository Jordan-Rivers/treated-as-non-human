Felt ill and unnaturally sleepy. Endured and went to the Dorset Police Headquarter to submit ID documents again.

Was stopped and missed the bus to leave the port the first time I tried to go out. Was told that my bag needed to be scanned. Was never needed before.

Took the next bus one hour later to go out and went to the Dorset Police Headquarter. Couldn't communicate. They just told to me to return to the barge, although I tried to tell them I was told to submit my ID documents there.

Waited and tried to tell them again and ask for a reason. The bell at the counter stopped working. Officers in uniform came. Last time they also called an officer in uniform and said the officer would help me. But the officers tried to tell me to go outside the building.

This time the officers said that they didn't need my ID documents and that I needed to leave. Tried to tell them I was told to submit my ID documents for a request. They just repeated they didn't need my documents. My belongings was taken away. Was surrounded by 4 officers when I found them outside the building to get my belongings back. Tried to say the same and ask for a reason, but they just repeated same and left when building was locked.

Vomited after I returned to the barge and ate.
