Three full years.\
Still treated as non-human, harassed, stalked, insulted, assaulted, molested, falsely allegated.

Was stopped on the street by the police and was given back one damaged phone and one phone with no sim. Asked for my other properties, the police said he thought those were everything.

Went to the Stevenage police station to ask for the remaining properties. Was denied and was told that the officer was on leave again.

The perpetrator are lurking around again. The police has yet to answer about the case and provide records and information.

Went to the Stevenage police station to ask for the remaining properties (with a different reference number for unknown reason) again. Got them back although there were questions unanswered.\
Found that they sent an email to an email address I had no access to because they retained my phone, that told me to I could get my property back just after they refused me at the police station.\
I don't know how many problem there are and how many I will find/miss.\

Although this has is not new, I want to highlight it again. They are still mocking me about the permanent damage they have done to my respiratory system with fake coughs.


I do not understand why any human could have done all these to another human. Before the assaults there were already permanent health damages, unknown substances and devices used against my will, communication/information interception, etc.

You would think that anyone with the slightest humanity would feel remorse for the permanent health damages alone. They don't. They continued to damage my health and mock me with fake coughs for more than one year already, all while committing more and more crimes against me.

Are we really the same species? How could they do all these to me if they are human and they also see me as a human?

Oh, and good f grief, they are authorities.

I am sure I have done nothing to Lithuania and the UK to deserve these years of persecution.
