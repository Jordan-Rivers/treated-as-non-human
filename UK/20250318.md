Both today and yesterday I went to the Home Office in Westminster.
Told about feeling being tormented, asked only for some basic information about my situation. Wasn't even allowed to enter the building.

Many things happened in these two days. I will repeat what I have said before. They do not appreciate any good behaviour. They know crystal clearly that they are commmitting crimes against me. And they are going out of their way to do so.

Although I have told them how bad I have been feeling, with "baby, hehehe", "mustafa, huhuhu" or "whatever, hahaha", it is enough for them to continue these years-long torture.

So this is the world.
