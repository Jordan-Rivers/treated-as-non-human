Still treated as a non-human owned by the persecutors.

What happened in the past months very well reflected what the true nature of the persecution in the past years.

Still treated as non-human.
From what I can see most likely they are still commiting crimes other than those I have recently mentioned against me.

How much I have been drugged (or put under some kind of effect by other means)?
If count by day it would be hundreds. If count by instance, it would be thousands.
What motherfuckingly sick absolute scum can treat a human being like this?
What motherfuckingly sick absolute scum can treat a human being like this and then put up fuck faces emit fuck voices and act like they are the ones outraged?

Woke up at around 4 a.m.. Played a game on my phone. Almost fell back asleep, or rather, fell unconcious dozens or a hundred of times in 2-3 hours. It took only seconds for me to (briefly) lose conciousness again after I tried my best to stay awake. It is not the first time I experience this. I might know more about what happened than before.

There are other similar things. Like waking up finding myself in various conditions.
Unnatural sleep, which may start with losing conciousness, became quite often.

I have a feeling that there are functions other than respiration getting hurt long-term/permanently.

And there are some other old things recurring.

Put into sleep with unknown substance around 10 p.m.. Woke up around 2 a.m. feeling my body under vibration, same as yesterday. This is part of what I have been enduring.

22 months in Lithuania. 1 year in the UK. And they condemn me for anti social behaviour.

Spent more than a month trying to get an email address from the police for requesting the retration of the warning based of on a shameless false accusation. Haven't been able to get even the email address yet.

Likewise, haven't been able to get information about the situation from the Home Office.

Basically I am being used to satisfy their sick desires everyday. Everyday is torture. Everyday is an insult.
