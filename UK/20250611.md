38th month treated as non-human counting only from the application of asylum in Lithuania. Suffering permanent health damages, harassment, stalking, insults, assaults, drugging, molestation, false allegation, and more.

Haven't written an entry for more than one months. Of course it's not because anything changed. My health continues to be damaged here and there. Since the persecutors group assaulted, arrested and destoryed my phone used to record, the sickness shows again everywhere.
