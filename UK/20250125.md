34th month of dehumanising surveillance, harassment, insult and harm

There're several times I considered the possibility of misunderstanding and tried to communicate about it. But the it was dodged or the communication was deied, just like in Lithuania.
Whether it was the foreign persecutors or the local on the other end of the communication, it wouldn't be possible if they cared.

Never have I thought that I would become so hatred-filled.
Never have I thought such absolute scum could be bred outside and far away from the wall.
