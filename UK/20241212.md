Still cough mildly when I move my body in daily activities such as exercises or sometimes even when I am not moving.

The day I woke up in a hospital (Luton & Dunstable University Hospital) I was approached by some people posing as medical staff. One of them had some documents and I saw that it stated from where I was taken by the ambulance. I asked for it and that gave me the horribly worded discharge note that stated only that I was found on a street. And then I was rushed to leave by security.

Have been sleeping in the living room since the door to the room I was moved to in early October is locked and I have only a key to the back door of the house. My request to the Home Office for a full record of the asylum accommodations I have been assigned to is still not responded to. Meanwhile, I am asked for my address repeatedly everywhere, including by the police who refused to help contact the Home Office. Someone told me the (house) manager told me to sleep in the room and gave me some keys yesterday. After entering the unlocked room the person came to ask me to try the keys. They didn't open the door. Later I found that they were keys to the back door. Returned all but one. Was told that the manager would give me the keys today yesterday.

Harassment has become more aggressive since the day I was taken into custody and woke up finding a warning note about the false accusation - filming children. It's nonsense in more ways than one. The funny thing is that for a period, there were increased children and even increased baby strollers on the street. Both on the way to and at the town centre of Stevenage.

After the assault I mentioned in the last entry, I was also assaulted on:
1 Dec 2024
9 Dec 2024

Although not serious, obviously they shouldn't have happened.

Asked for CCTV footage from shops both by online methods and in person. One said that after talking to the police they cannot give me the footage because it's against the law.

`You have the right to request CCTV footage of yourself.
You need to make a request to the owner of the CCTV system. You can do this either in writing or verbally.`

Tesco, Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank and Halifax Bank told me I could only ask the police to help when I walked in to request the footage in person.

Soon after a manager came to talk to me at my request at the service counter of Tesco a security member approached. There were also other strange things that happened when I was at the banks.

Careful readers should have an idea about what's happening.
