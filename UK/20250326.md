Yesterday, I refreshed the air in the room for dozens or more than a hundred times by waving a towel when I smell something. I still fell ill by the end of the day.

The rooms that are supposed to be the asylum accommodation I am assigned to have always been ones with problems. Or rather, it's not necessarily problems of the room but of the persecutors.

One of the problem is the rooms will be filled with unknown gases. Recently, it happened frequently.
