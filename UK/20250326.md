The rooms that are supposed to be the asylum accommodations I am assigned to have always been ones with problems. Or rather, many of the problems are not necessarily problems of the room but of the persecutors.

One of the problem is the rooms will be filled with unknown gases. The frequency is not constant. It remained frequent in recent days.

Yesterday, I refreshed the air in the room for dozens, perhaps more than a hundred, times by waving a towel when I smelled something. I still fell ill by the end of the day.
