one more month and it will be 2 yeas and half.

It only become increasingly clear that I am used for experiment amomg other things, not treated as a human. Not only is it not getting any better, it is getting worse. More blatantly disregarding that I am a human being.
Not only constantly put under surveillance and harassment, but also constantly put under multiple effects. There are still other things. Some as bad as the last.

How fucking sick one has to be to treat another human being like this? Or should I ask how fuck sick one thousand have to be?But obviously the count won't stop at the thousand I have already met.
